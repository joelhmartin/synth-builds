<!-- 

This site's purpose is to be an area where people can post their patch layouts for synthesizers. I have plans to incorporate
a simple synth that people can program to sit alongside their synth posts where they can create a basic recreation to show 
anyone who might be interested, how to create the synth patch on any device. 

clone the repository

run 'npm install' on your terminal

and then run 'yarn run dev'

The backend is hosted from an EC2 instance on AWS
